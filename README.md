# Women-Safety-Analytics-V1
Built a real-time system using a CNN model for violence detection (98.2% accuracy) and Haar Cascade for gender classification. Integrated OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras for image processing and deep learning to detect threats and trigger real-time alerts.

- Developed a real-time system for gender classification and threat detection using a custom-trained CNN model for
violence detection and Haar Cascade for gender classification, achieving 98.2% accuracy.
- Utilized OpenCV for image processing, and integrated TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the deep learning
model to detect potential dangers and generate real-time alerts.
